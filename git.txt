Here's a step-by-step guide to create a new branch and upload a new version of your code to GitHub:

1. First, navigate to your project directory:
bash
cd path/to/your/project
2. Check your current status and branches:
bash
git status
git branch
3. Create and switch to a new branch (for your new version):
bash
git checkout -b new-version
4. Make your changes to the code, then stage them:
bash
git add .
# Or add specific files:
# git add anonymizer.py README.md requirements.txt
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
bash
git commit -m "Added enhanced anonymization features and improved logging"
6. Push the new branch to GitHub:
bash
git push origin new-version
7. (Optional) If you want to merge this into main branch:
bash
git checkout main
git merge new-version
git push origin main
8. (Optional) Create a version tag for your release:
bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0 with improved name detection"
git push origin v1.1.0
Additional Tips:
If it's your first push to a new branch, Git might suggest this command:

bash
git push --set-upstream origin new-version
To see all your branches:

bash
git branch -a
To delete a branch after merging (cleanup):

bash
git branch -d new-version  # local delete
git push origin --delete new-version  # remote delete
To update your local repository with remote changes:

bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
This workflow:

Keeps your main branch stable

Allows development in separate branches

Makes it easy to track different versions

Enables you to create proper releases with tags
